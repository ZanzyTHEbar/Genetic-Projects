# Project Overview
This project focuses on using a malarial protein (var2csa) fused with the Fc segment of human IgG1 antibody and the secretory signal from IgG2 to act as an immunotherapy for treating cancers. Curerntly this is based on a lentiviral vector but other vectors are possible as well. The truncated var2csa (denoted rVar2) binds to glycosoaminoglycans that are only found on cancer cell lines and human placenta. However the number of different cancer varieties it binds to is quite simply staggering. This plasmid will be synthesized and made availiable as soon as possible, and is planned for animal testing as soon as reasonably possible as well.

The plasmid called "definitly not zombie serum v1" is the same as "pLV-EF1a-IRES-Puro rvar2 igg1 fc igg2 secretion". Both are the same version of the plasmid, but it's such a serious project it felt only right to have a little fun. Contributors who can make suggestions for improvements are encouraged to submit pull requests.

## Patch notes

2020/0707 - Added "definitely not zombie serum" V2 and V3. In V2 the construct insert was migrated to an AAV vector over concerns of carcinogenic properties of lentiviral vectors, which seemed like they would defeat the whole point of this. This required changed the restriction sites on the ends of the insert from bamhi and ecori, to ecori and ndei. In V3 the fc fragment was changed from a wild type IgG to a synthetic IgGA. It comes from this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552114004098?via%3Dihub
This should make the final "antibody" have a much higher affinity for FcyR receptors and more likely to induce a antibody dependant cellular cytotoxic/phagocytosis. The synthetic antibody triggers not only neutrophils, but also macrophages AND the compliment system. This is important as neutrophils are particularly good at penetrating solid tumors and the compliment system is as well. I've also stopped bothering to upload double copies of the plasmids. We're going with the funny name from now on, and will give it a more serious name once the project progresses.
