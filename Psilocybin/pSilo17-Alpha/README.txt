How Plasmid Works: 

Psilocybin biosynthesis pathway consisting of three
heterologous enzymes; PsiD, PsiK, and PsiM. Utilising E-Coli TrpB to convert 4-hydroxyindole to precursor 4-HTP

PsiD: L-tryptophan decarboxylase

PsiK: kinase

PsiM: S-adensoyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent N-methyltransferase

TrpB: tryptophan synthase beta subunit

1.) 4-hydroxyindole is converted into 4-hydroxytryptophan (4-HTP) (serine is consumed)

2.) 4-HTP is metabolised into 4-hydroxytryptamine by PsiD

3.) 4-hydroxytryptamine to norbaeocystin by PsiK

4.) norbaeocystin to baeocystin by PsiM (Methionine is consumed)

5.) Baeocystin to Psilocybin by PsiM (Methionine is consumed)

Instructions for plasmid: 

Transform all High, Medium, and Low promoter plasmids into the E-Coli strain of your choice. 2 or 3 plasmids per cell,
with one plasmid once a well performing strain is isolated and cloned. 

Growth Medium: 

A growth medium containing Serine, Methionine, 4-hydroxyindole, and glucose in solution. For more details see the white paper.
